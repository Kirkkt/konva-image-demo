This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Konva.js renders images as a layer in canvas, and it treat each layer individually, meaning if one
layer is changed, it doesn't require the whole canvas to be re-rendered. This is great for
on-the-fly complex image processing, especially filtering.
